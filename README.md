#Requirements
To create a CRUD application of our choice that uses the technologies and methods we have learned up to this point namely:
*A Kanban board
*A relational database to store at least two tables persistently and a model of their relationship
*Clear documentation and a risk assesment
*A python based CRUD application made using best practices such as TDD
*Test suites and automated tests for the application. Must have a high coverage with consistent reports and evidence
*A functioning front end
*A version control system using the Feature-Branch model
*Code built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud based VM

**Solution**
I settled on making a simple d&d character sheet platform that allows the user to create, read, update and delete characters based on the d&d 5E ruleset. It will also have an admin function to allow for the dungeon master to view the character sheets of their players for the purpose of session planning
